# rock-paper-scissors

Created a rock paper scissors games that gets the computer to randomly select either rock, paper or scissors.  It also get the user input and checks to see who won each round.  After each round it will say if the computer or person won the game and will give the updated score.  Whoever reaches 5 wins first wins the whole game and the program stops.
